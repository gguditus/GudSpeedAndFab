# Welcome to Guditus Speed and Fabrication!

This is a website created to document the progress of projects around the Guditus Garage.
Our projects include engine swaps, full blown body-off resto-mods, simple repairs, machine restorations, shop improvements, and working on anything with an engine.
Follow along on the Blog or the Build Gallery (Coming Soon).
As with any project in the shop, this website is a work in progress. It was built with Next.JS and Tailwind and is hosted on Linode. All development was done by Greg Guditus.
